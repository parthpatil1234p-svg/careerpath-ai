        "options": [
          "'unknown' disables all type checking just like 'any'",
          "'unknown' is type-safe; you must perform type checking or narrowing before performing operations on it",

        ],
        "correctIndex": 1,
        "explanation": "'unknown' is the type-safe counterpart of 'any'. TypeScript prevents invoking methods or reading properties on 'unknown' without prior type narrowing."
