## 📖 Project Overview

**CareerPath AI** is an intelligent, interactive 3D web platform designed to bridge the gap between academic education and modern industry career expectations. 

Millions of undergraduate students graduate each year without clear visibility into modern tech stacks, how their existing coursework maps to real-world roles, or what concrete steps are required to become job-ready.

CareerPath AI replaces confusing career tests and generic course catalogs with an **objective, deterministic AI recommendation engine** and an **immersive 3D learning experience**. By evaluating a student’s academic background, technical/soft skills, and domain interests, the platform delivers:
1. **Top 3 Matched Career Paths** ranked with a mathematically transparent scoring model.
2. **Granular Skill-Gap Analysis** categorizing skills into Matched, Needs Upgrade, and Missing.
3. **Personalized 4, 8, or 12-Week Roadmaps** with weekly milestone tasks and curated free learning resources.
4. **Interactive 3D WebGL Visualizations** (powered by Three.js & GSAP) that transform abstract skill gaps and roadmaps into engaging planetary orbits and milestone journeys.

## 🎯 Problem Statement & Target Users

### The Problem
- **Degree-Industry Disconnect:** Universities focus heavily on theory; students lack visibility into modern tech stacks.
- **Subjective Career Advice:** Traditional career tests rely on high-level surveys rather than objective skill assessments.
- **Analysis Paralysis:** When students identify a career goal, they are overwhelmed by hundreds of uncurated courses without a time-boxed execution plan.

### The Proposed Solution
- **Objective Profiling:** Capture degree, interests, and skills with individual proficiency levels (Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced).
- **Explainable Scoring:** 100% deterministic weighted scoring without black-box AI hallucinations.
- **Actionable Execution:** Dynamic learning roadmaps with built-in task tracking and live dashboard telemetry.

### Target Users
- **Undergraduate Students (BCA, B.Tech, BSc CS):** Seeking clarity on tech specializations and internship readiness.
- **Self-Taught Learners & Career Switchers:** Needing to identify exact skill blind spots and follow a structured curriculum.

- 🔍 **Skill-Gap Analysis:** Categorizes required skills into:
  - 🟢 **Matched Skills:** Student meets or exceeds required proficiency level.
  - 🟡 **Weak / Upgrade Needed:** Student possesses the skill but requires higher depth.
  - 🔴 **Missing Skills:** Critical required skills absent from student profile.
- 🗺️ **Personalized Roadmap Generation:** Flexible 4, 8, or 12-week structured curricula prioritizing missing and weak skills first, complete with curated documentation and tutorial links.

## 🌌 3D Interactive Web Experience (Three.js + GSAP)

CareerPath AI integrates four purposeful 3D visual modules that represent the student's journey:

| 3D Experience | Canvas Container | Page Location | Purpose & Interaction |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Career Universe** | `#careerUniverse` | `client/index.html` | Celestial constellation of career nodes and connecting star dust; represents infinite opportunities. |
| **Skill Orbit** | `#skill-orbit` | `client/recommendations.html` | Concentric planetary orbital tracks visualizing matched (green), weak (amber), and missing (red) skills. |
| **Roadmap Path** | `#roadmap-path` | `client/roadmap.html` | 3D stepping-stone trail of glowing milestones representing the weekly progression. |
| **Progress Orb** | `#progress-orb` | `client/dashboard.html` | Holographic energy sphere pulsing and glowing based on active roadmap completion percentage. |

> **Graceful 2D Fallback:** If WebGL or hardware acceleration is unsupported on the client device, all pages automatically render clean, accessible **2D HTML/CSS cards** without impacting page functionality.
